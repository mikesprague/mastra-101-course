## About

- I used Azure OpenAI for the course and decided to abstract the model logic into it's own module
- My code is slightly different from the course as I refactored some of the logic but the core concepts are the same
- There were a couple errors/bad references in the course but I was able to work through them and at the time of writing all included content works
- When I ran `mastra create` to start the project for this course, I had it include the example (meaning the weather agent, tool, and workflow are included but are NOT part of the course)
